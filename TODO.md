TODOs:


Finished

- [x] in the chatbot page, now we have two test buttons, I want to replace them with two agents and user can fell free to switch between them, the first agent is used to call llm to understand and analyze transation to add to ledge, the second is an agent help to analyze the past transations and make finance suggestions. help me name these two agent mode and build the new button. by theway, mark the second agent mode as (comming), and when clicked, redirect to upgrade to master landing page.


- [x] on the model setting page, mark Cloud as COMMING and make the option unselectable, if user click the option, redirect to upgrade to master landingpage

- [x] when the seller select "edit" after chatbot infer the result, show a form page allowing user to edit each field of the transation instead of going back to the chat page.
- [x] Wallet management should only ask for user to provider a public wallet address instead integrate a whole wallet, we should only need the wallet address to tracking the trasactions haapens on chain.
