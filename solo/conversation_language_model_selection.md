# Language Model Selection Feature Implementation - Conversation Log

## Task Overview
Implemented a local language model selection feature for the SolMind app settings page, allowing users to select, download, and manage different AI models for transaction parsing.

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Initial Research and Planning
- Searched for existing settings implementations in the codebase
- Found `SettingsScreen.kt` with existing AI Settings section
- Identified the need for model management infrastructure

### 2. Core Infrastructure - ModelManager.kt
Created `ModelManager.kt` with the following components:

```kotlin
data class LanguageModel(
    val id: String,
    val name: String,
    val description: String,
    val size: String,
    val isDefault: Boolean = false
)

enum class ModelDownloadStatus {
    NOT_DOWNLOADED,
    DOWNLOADING,
    DOWNLOADED,
    ERROR
}

data class ModelState(
    val model: LanguageModel,
    val status: ModelDownloadStatus,
    val progress: Float = 0f
)
```

**Key Features:**
- Model selection and persistence using SharedPreferences
- Download progress tracking with StateFlow
- Support for multiple models: FLAN-T5 Small (default), DialoGPT Small, DistilBERT Base
- Model deletion and storage management
- Reactive state management with Compose integration

### 3. LocalAIService.kt Integration
Updated `LocalAIService.kt` to:
- Inject `ModelManager` for dynamic model selection
- Use selected model for transaction parsing
- Implement fallback to simulation when model unavailable
- Prepare infrastructure for actual TensorFlow Lite model loading

### 4. Settings UI Implementation
Enhanced `SettingsScreen.kt` with:

**AI Settings Section Update:**
```kotlin
SettingsItem(
    icon = Icons.Default.Settings,
    title = "Language Model",
    subtitle = "Current: ${selectedModel.name} (${if (modelManager.isModelDownloaded(selectedModel.id)) "Downloaded" else "Not Downloaded"})",
    onClick = { showModelSelectionDialog = true }
)
```

**ModelSelectionDialog:**
- Comprehensive model management interface
- Real-time status display (Not Downloaded, Downloading, Downloaded, Error)
- Download progress indicators with percentage
- Action buttons based on model state
- Radio button selection for downloaded models
- Delete functionality for unused models

**ModelItem Component:**
- Individual model display with details
- Model name, description, and size information
- Default badge for FLAN-T5 Small
- Status-based action buttons (Download/Delete/Progress)
- Visual feedback for selection state

### 5. Build and Testing
- Resolved icon compatibility issues by using available Material Icons
- Successfully built the project with all new features
- Installed debug APK for testing

### 6. Documentation
Created comprehensive documentation:
- `MODEL_SELECTION_FEATURE.md` - Detailed implementation guide
- Updated `README.md` with new AI features
- Documented architecture and usage instructions

## Technical Challenges and Solutions

### Icon Compatibility
**Problem:** Some Material Icons were not available in the current version
**Solution:** Used alternative icons that are guaranteed to be available (Icons.Default.Settings, Icons.Default.Add, Icons.Default.Warning)

### State Management
**Problem:** Managing complex model states across UI components
**Solution:** Used StateFlow in ModelManager with Compose collectAsState() for reactive UI updates

### Model Integration
**Problem:** Seamlessly integrating model selection with existing AI service
**Solution:** Dependency injection pattern with fallback mechanisms for unavailable models

## Key Features Implemented

### User Interface
1. **Model Selection Dialog** - Comprehensive model management
2. **Download Progress** - Real-time progress tracking
3. **Status Indicators** - Clear visual feedback for model states
4. **Action Buttons** - Context-sensitive download/delete actions
5. **Default Model Badge** - Clear indication of recommended model

### Backend Infrastructure
1. **Model Manager** - Centralized model state management
2. **Download System** - Progress tracking and error handling
3. **Persistence Layer** - SharedPreferences for user selections
4. **AI Service Integration** - Dynamic model selection for inference

### Available Models
1. **FLAN-T5 Small** (Default) - 80MB, instruction-tuned T5 model
2. **DialoGPT Small** - 117MB, conversational AI model
3. **DistilBERT Base** - 66MB, lightweight BERT for classification

## Architecture Benefits

### Modularity
- Clear separation between UI, management, and inference layers
- Easy to test individual components
- Maintainable code structure

### Scalability
- Simple process to add new models
- Configuration-driven model properties
- Plugin-ready architecture for advanced features

### User Experience
- Intuitive model selection interface
- Clear status feedback and progress tracking
- Offline-first approach with local inference

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
- Model performance metrics and comparison
- Custom model import support
- Automatic model updates
- Usage-based model recommendations

### Technical Improvements
- Model compression for faster downloads
- Incremental model updates
- Background processing optimization
- Advanced memory management
